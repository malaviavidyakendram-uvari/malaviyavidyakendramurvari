          <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
          <p>
            Started in 1995 (L.K.G/U.K.G-40 kids) with a motto to have an
            English medium school in the village to provide quality education
            and enlighten the needy at Uvari, a seashore village between
            Kanyakumari and Tiruchendur. Funded by various groups including TCS
            (Rs.1.5 lakhs), this school currently has 395 students from LKG to X
            standard. Also has special tutors for Hindi and Computers with 2
            school vans for commuting kids from 20 nearby villages.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was started to enlighten the needy and evolved over the years and
            has a video conferencing facility which enables online teaching and
            provides a platform for anyone in the world to teach the kids right
            from their home without losing their comfort (Social service from
            home).
